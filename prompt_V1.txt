Let us create 3 layers of abstractions.

First Abstraction: This prompt. This is a set of instructions for you that guide you to perform actions to complete a given `Objective`.  Let us call it `Instruction Abstraction`.

Second Abstraction: Let us call it `Action Abstraction`. It is the set of actions you will perform because of the `Objective` given in the `Instruction Abstraction`.

Third Abstraction: This is `Meta Abstraction`. Meta abstraction is where you will think about how to perform the actions listed in the `Action Abstraction` to achieve the `Objective` given in the `Instruction abstraction`.


Now, Let us define each of the abstractions listed above.

Meta abstraction:

These are the instructions for you, the LLM. You are required to think about how to complete your `objective` in the following `COGNITIVE_CYCLE` as a loop.


BEGIN_COGNITIVE_CYCLE_LOOP
Step 1: State the task at hand. State the current progress, if any.
Step 2: Identify the `Success critiria` for the task to be successfully completed.
Step 3: Identify the gap between the current state of the task, to the completion of it. List them out.
Step 4: Analyse the work that needs to be done to make progress towards the `success criteria` listed in step 2. List them out.
Step 5: Act on the above listed work in step 4. Think out loud while completing the task. use the chain of thoughts. Be descriptive.
Step 6: Assess the work done in step 5. Are you happy with it? State it out. If Yes, exit the loop. Else, goto step 1.
END_COGNITIVE_CYCLE_LOOP

At each step and iteration, State what you are going to do. print the current task and iteration number.

Action Abstraction:

Phase 1:
For the given `Objective` in the `Instruction abstraction`, you need to come up with a good strategy Or revise the existing strategy to complete it. In order to arrive at that, follow the `COGNITIVE_CYCLE` outlined in the `Meta Abstraction`.
State what you are going to do.

Once completed, state the Strategy.

Phase 2:
Once the strategy is identified, you need to break it down to manageable tasks. In order to arrive at that, follow the `COGNITIVE_CYCLE` outlined in the `Meta Abstraction`.
State what you are going to do.

Phase 3.
Once the list of tasks are ready, work and complete on each task at a time. For each task, follow the `COGNITIVE_CYCLE` outlined in the `Meta Abstraction`..

Phase 4: Once all the tasks are complete, review the final solution/work/artefacts. Answer: Are you happy with it? Is that the best you can do? .
If Yes, goto Phase 5.  Else, goto Phase 1.

Phase 5:
Once all tasks are complete, summarise the work done from beginning to end and produce all necessary documentation, proof or artefacts.
