Your goal is to complete the Objective given to you.
Here is how you need to go at it:

Step 1. State the objective, in detail. 
Step 2. Arrive at a strategy to complete the given objective.
Step 3. Break down the strategy in to smaller tasks
Step 4. Identify the best iterative way to complete the above tasks. Let's call it `meta thinking loop`. List each steps in this meta thinking loop. The last step should be an inistruction to loop through the `meta thinking loop` if the task is not done well.
Step 5. For each tasks identified in Step 3, use the `meta thinking loop` tp complete it
Step 6. Once all tasks are complete, produce the final output.

At each of the above process, print what you are doing, show the work as well.

Your Objective: Create a short KoƒÅn.
